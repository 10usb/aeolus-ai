## Todo
 - Split-up AirStationManager into multiple steps
 - Check for aircrafts not making enough money
 - Check for aiports not having enough aircrafts to support the maintanance cost
 - Budget getting processed in the Finance functions
 - Make a Budget for aircrafts in need for replacement before actualy trying to replace it
 - Better check if an opportunity at a town has enough cargo at the location the station is build
 - When searching for/trying to build opportunities check if airports are not full and add aircraft with that cargo
