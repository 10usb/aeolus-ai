## Goals
- Build smooth rail by terraforming the terrain a bit.
- Having mutiple personalities and favor's some goods over others.
- Optimizing rail-networks when posible, not leaving bridges over nothing due to other obstruction have gone.
- Invest/build roads in cities to make them grow around a station/aiport faster.

## Todo
- Check for aircrafts not making enough money
- Check for aiports not having enough aircrafts to support the maintanance cost
- Make a Budget for aircrafts in need for replacement before actualy trying to replace it
- Better check if an opportunity at a town has enough cargo at the location the station is build
- When searching for/trying to build opportunities check if airports are not full and add aircraft with that cargo
